# Unit-Eight
 In this project, I built a web application that includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books. I was able to implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
Please install npm to run this repo. Thank you in advance for your consideration.
